        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>This implementation of Lights Out was created with the following considerations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The game board is a 5x5 grid created dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>Each click toggles the clicked cell and its adjacent cells (top, bottom, left, right).</li>
            <li>The initial board state is generated by simulating random clicks to ensure it's solvable.</li>
            <li>Win condition is checked after every move by verifying all cells are white.</li>
            <li>The design uses a simple black and white color scheme with Comic Sans MS font for a playful look.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initially struggled with generating random but solvable boards. Solved by starting with all lights on and simulating random valid moves.</li>
            <li>Ensuring boundary conditions worked correctly (edge/corner cells). Solved by carefully checking neighbor indices in getNeighbors().</li>
            <li>Implementing smooth transitions between states. Used CSS transitions for visual feedback.</li>
        </ul>
