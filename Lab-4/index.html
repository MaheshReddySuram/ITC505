            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong> A professional and readable font (e.g., 'Georgia' for a classic look or 'Roboto' for modern clarity).</p>
            <p><strong>Text and Heading Sizes:</strong> Headings have a clear hierarchy, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> as the largest, followed by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. The body text maintains a comfortable reading size.</p>
            <p><strong>Color Choices:</strong> The background is a light shade, ensuring contrast with black text for readability. Headings use a subtle color variation for distinction.</p>
            <p><strong>Margin and Padding Choices:</strong> Sufficient spacing is applied to sections, paragraphs, and lists for better readability.</p>

            <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
            <p>Previously, some HTML elements were used for styling purposes rather than structure. This has been corrected by ensuring proper heading levels and semantic elements.</p>
